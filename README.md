# Tame-Uppermill-FloodRisk  
Analysis of Tame river Uppermill river level Gauge readings  

Gauge data for Uppermill Tame river was obtained from :  

https://riverlevels.uk/tame-saddleworth-uppermill#.XJImV4WnyV5  

This data contains an average level for the day and a maximum and minimum level for the day.  


### Observations :

Analysis shows the change in level per day has slightly decreased since 2012.

Yet, the level of floods has increased (apart from one outlier flood in 2013) ....


The data analysed is from daily averages - it underestimates the rate of change. This chart shows the raw change for one day.



### Conclusion :

This proves beyond all doubt that less water is causing the same floods height levels.  Remember - this is an analysis of the Average level - not the Maximum level ........

If the reduction in river level change per day could be less rain or the effect of drains,

1. These do not ameliorate  the speed of build up of water and maximum flood height
2. If these drains fail due to blockage , it is liable to quickly cause disastrous flood heights as any increase would be.
